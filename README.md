# GravitationSimulator
A C++ simulator for tracking the movements of celestial objects. When the program is run, the user is prompted to answer several questions such as the number of objects they would like to simulate, the masses of the objects, their initial locations and velocities, etc.. The program then runs the simulation and outputs 3 lists corresponding to the x, y, and z coordinates of the objects through time, as well as (optionally) a list of the objects' relative speeds through time. 

NOTE: the gravitational constant is currently set to 1 to make toying with the simulator easier. For accurate results, update the variable "G" in the mass.h file to represent the correct value of the gravitational constant.
